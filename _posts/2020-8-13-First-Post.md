title: What is Data Science? 
---

What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
I think being a data scientist is about taking large amounts of data and turning it into useful knowledge. This includes the process of getting the data into a usable format, as well as the statistical and machine learning techniques used to mine the data for insights.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
There are three primary knowledge areas: coding skills, math/statistics, and domain knowledge.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
Generally speaking data scientists seem to have a more practical bent, whereas statisticians can spend more time in the theoretical. Also, computer science knowledge and skills play a heavier role for data scientists.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I would say I am closer to the data science side, since my application (outside of my degree program) of statistical knowledge is applied in a practical business setting, where the analytics span a much more diverse range of techniques than the tools of traditional statistics.
