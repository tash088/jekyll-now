title: Project 1 Reflections

For Project 1, I created a vignette that walks the user through how to access data from the NHL records and NHL stats APIs. It interweaves regular text with code and R output, so that the user can see exactly how I'm accessing and modifying the data for analysis. I used plots, contingency tables, and quantitative summaries to explore the data. Through this analysis, I came up with a few findings: 
* There was a burst of activity forming NHL teams in the 1920s, several of those franchises are no longer around.
* Not surprisingly, the age of a franchise (i.e., years since its founding) has a very strong correlation with total games played.
* The Carolina Hurricane's roster of goalies are not "long timers".
* The Hurricanes have performed slightly better than the Whalers, at least in terms of their ratio of goals for vs. goals against.
