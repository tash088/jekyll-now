title: Project 1 Reflections

Here is the link to my results for Project 1: [https://tash088.github.io/gocanes/](https://tash088.github.io/gocanes/)

For Project 1, I created a vignette that walks the user through how to access data from the NHL records and NHL stats APIs. I used plots, contingency tables, and quantitative summaries to explore the data. A few findings: 
* There was a burst of activity forming NHL teams in the 1920s, several of those franchises are no longer around.
* Not surprisingly, the age of a franchise (i.e., years since its founding) has a very strong correlation with total games played.
* The Hurricanes have performed slightly better than the Whalers, at least in terms of their ratio of goals for to goals against.

As I reflect on the project, there are a few things that stand out:
* I spent enormous amounts of time with seemingly trivial stuff. For example, I spent way too much time trying to get this blog post to show up, simply because I did not end the post name with ".md". I had a similar experience while coding in R, the smallest details can eat up a ton of time. Each one in and of itself is not that big of a deal, but in aggregate they massively increase the time needed to complete the project.
* I think I've been spoiled by the dummy-proof user interfaces of consumer technology platforms from Apple, Google, Instagram, etc. So something like Github and R, that are much more flexible but require more domain knowledge to operate can be very frustrating. If I'm creating a post on Instagram, they would never require me to magically know, or dig through some arcane documentation to find out that ".md" needed to come at the end of my blog name or its not going to show up. But again, I realize that this is just a function of me being both ignorant and spoiled :).
* I had a hard time figuring out how to interact with the APIs. But became more comfortable with it over the course of the project.
* As far as what I would do differently on future projects, I'd like to say I would start on it earlier, but that is probably a pipe dream as other commitments (and other work from this course) will always be competing for time resources.
* One potential action step I could take is to schedule time in advance to attend office hours. I should just go ahead and assume that I will get stuck on some things and need some guidance that can't be efficiently accessed via Google searches.
