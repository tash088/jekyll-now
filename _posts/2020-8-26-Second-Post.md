**Learning R**
---

What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used? 
</b>
In my studies and professional work I've really just used SAS. While I'm more comfortable with SAS simply due to
experience, I do not have a strong preference for either as I see the many virtues of R even though it does not come
naturally yet.
</b>
 
What functionality do you like about R?  
</b>
I like the fact that there is a package and a function for pretty much anything and the names/syntax are intuitive.
For example, want to read in a csv file? Put the path of your file into read_csv(), easy peasy.
</b>

What parts do you miss about your other language?  
</b>
Just the comfort level, I have to be more thoughtful and do more Googling when using R, simply because I'm new to it. 
In particular, I miss being able to debug better--I am used to interpreting the errors in the log in SAS, with R its 
harder for me to figuer out what is going wrong, though that'll probably come with time as well.
</b>
 
Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? 
</b>
Learning a new language is always a challenge, but R does not seem to be any more difficult than other langugages.
