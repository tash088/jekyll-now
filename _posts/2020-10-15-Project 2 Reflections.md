For Project 2, I used predictive models, specifically a regression tree and a boosted tree model, to predict the count of bikes used in a D.C.-area bike sharing program. The data set included variables such as weather conditions, day of the week, time of year, etc. Using this information we were able to make reasonably good predictions on how many bikes would be utilized. In addition to the modeling work, this project provided practice using GitHub, doing exploratory data analysis (summary statistics and plots), and automating reports using parameters in R markdown.

A few thoughts on the project:

This project went more smoothly than Project #1 for me (largely because I had worked out some of the kinks in interacting with GitHub), so there is not much I would do differently. If anything, I'd probably try to finish it before the due date rather than waiting until the last minute. It seems the age old problem of procrastination is a persistent one.

The most difficult part of the project for me was learning how to properly use the train() and gbm() functions during the modeling process, particularly when it comes to tuning parameters.

My takeaways from this project are: 1)boosted tree models a powerful tool for doing predictive modeling and, 2) one must be ever-vigilant in the fight against procrastination.
